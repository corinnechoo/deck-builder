# Deck Builder Backend App

This is a card selection app for the game Hearthstone. It generates 30 cards picked randomly from the Rastakhanâ€™s Rumble expansion pack given one of the following player class - Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, Warrior, Neutral, and no more than 2 cards are repeated. 

The assumption that the field 'name' is used to differentiate whether cards are the same is made based on preliminary analysis, since this field does not contain null values. In addition, since the data does not contain null values for the fields dbfId, name, playerClass, cardId, cardSet and cardType, it is assumed that all cards must have these fields. 

The database populated with all fields given in the raw dataset, though in the future we may only want to store important columns.

The X-Mashape-Key required for retrieving the raw data is stored in a .env file as HEARTHSTONE_KEY.
